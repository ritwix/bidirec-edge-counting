# bidirec-edge-counting
### Bidirectional edge counting for time varying networks.

The relevant code is in __bidirec_edge_count_v3.ipynb__ and __bidirec_edge_count_v3_senegal.ipynb__.
The output file is __graph_with_counts.csv__

To do:
1. We need only copy edges until period + delta-1 (e.g. 12 mo + 5 - 1)
2. Postprocess the counts as described in the whiteboard.png
